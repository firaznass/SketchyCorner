            <h1>About the artist</h1>
            <p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to visit my website! My name is Zhafira Nasseer, and I'm the artist behind the sketches and drawings you'll find here. This "About" page is where I get to share a bit more about myself and my journey as an artist.</p>

            <h2>A passion for art</h2>
            <p>Ever since I was a child, I've been captivated by the world of art. Drawing and sketching became my favorite way to express myself and unleash my imagination. Over the years, my passion for art has only deepened, driving me to continually learn, grow, and evolve as an artist.</p>
            <p>What once started as a hobby has blossomed into a deep-seated passion. Art has become more than just a pastime; it's a calling. Through sketching and drawing, I've found a medium of self-expression and connection that resonates with me deeply. Now, I see art not just as a hobby but as a path I want to pursue in the future, whether through a career, sharing my work, or using art as a means of advocacy and communication.</p>

            <h3>Finding inspiration</h3>
            <p>In my art, I find inspiration in the beauty of everyday life, often drawing plants I encounter and capturing their delicate details. I also seek creative sparks on Pinterest, redrawing eye-catching images that ignite my imagination. Additionally, as a fan of games and anime, I love bringing characters from these worlds to life on paper. Each drawing is a celebration of the diverse sources of inspiration that fuel my creativity.</p>

            <h4>Stress-Relief</h4>
            <p>Art isn't just about creating masterpieces for meâ€”it's my stress-relief hack. Sometimes, I ditch the coherent drawings and just let my pencil wander aimlessly across the page. Sketching random things is my way of hitting pause on stress and getting lost in the moment. It's my creative outlet where imperfection is celebrated and stress fades away.</p>
